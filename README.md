# Amino_acid_sequence
Amino acid sequence prediction

- This is a health project I had to develop a model that can classify an amino acid sequence.  
- Develop a model that classify the amino acid sequences for a given organism. 

### Challenges:

- I wanted to develop Seq2Vec for the amino acid sequences but due to limited compute resource I had to leverage 
more simple and concise approach by using classical ML algorithm than language model.  
This was an open competition by Instadeep where I had to participate with my little compute resource.
